# Eye Movement

![Eye Movement](https://micwadeski.github.io/assets/images/development/eyes.jpg)

## Description

This is a coding exercise assigned through the MIT xPro "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course. The point of the exercise is to have two eyes in the middle of the screen that mimic and follow the movement of the mouse on the screen. This is done through JavaScript events that trigger DOM manipulation. The event that triggers the JavaScript is mouse movement, and the element being manipulated on the DOM in response to that is the eyes.

## Installation

Click the green "Code" button and download the .zip folder containing the repo to your local machine. Once it is downloaded, expand the folder and double click the index.html file to open it up in your default browser. You just have to make sure that all files are downloaded and placed within the same folder in order for the index.html file to work.

## Usage

Simply open up the index.html file and experiment by moving the mouse around on the page, the eyes will then follow your mouse movement.

## Roadmap

* Create a more detailed illustration, maybe give the face teeth, a nose, some hair and other features that make it more fun.
* Create more event triggered elements, like a tongue that will lick up everytime the mouse is physically clicked.
* Make the eyes blink ever 5 seconds.
* Make the mouth yawn every 15 seconds.
